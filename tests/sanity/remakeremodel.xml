        <content type="html" xml:lang="en" xml:base="http://chompy.net/blogs/jacob/"><![CDATA[<p>This week I read Robert Darnton&#8217;s pop history of 18th century French culture, The Great Cat Massacre, the first chapter of which attempts to get into the heads of the old regime French peasantry by examining their folk tales.  Reading these old peasant stories, which were passed on orally into the 19th and 20th centuries, not just across France but into the Caribbean and the Americas, one finds a worldview preoccupied by want, hunger, guile, and a certain kind of humor that is politely termed <em>Rabelaisian</em>.  (If you don&#8217;t know what that means, I&#8217;ll shortly provide an example.)</p>

<p>Curious to read a few primary texts, I bussed down to the university library yesterday and spent the morning copying pages from the three volumes of Le Conte populaire français, edited by Paul Delarue and Marie-Louise Tenèze.  Translation is for me a little like when a corporate manager attempts to perform an act of kindness &#8212; the results only come by straining against one&#8217;s natural disposition and ability, and they probably don&#8217;t fool anyone, either.  That said, read on for a story about a doll that poops gold.  Any errors and embellishments are my fault &#8212; sorry.</p>
<blockquote>
  La Poupée qui Mord (The Biting Doll)
  
  <p>Once upon a time there were three young and very poor girls who were so poor that, between the three of them, they only had one dress to wear.  When one of them went out, the other two had to stay inside.</p>
  
  <p>One day, though, they came upon a small amount of money, and the youngest one said:</p>
  
  <p>&#8212; I&#8217;m going to buy another dress &#8212; with that we can go out <em>two</em> at a time!</p>
  
  <p>She walked to town and came upon a merchant who sold rag dolls, dolls that he claimed crapped precious gold coins.  The young girl handed over all her money for a doll and quickly returned home.</p>
  
  <p>&#8212; We&#8217;re rich, she cried to her sisters.  I bought a doll that shits gold louis!</p>
  
  <p>&#8212; You dumbass, the others said, you may as well have chucked our money right into the ocean.</p>
  
  <p>But later, as night fell, the three sisters were settling into bed when they heard a little voice that said:</p>
  
  <p>&#8212; Give me some white toilet paper, because I need to shit&#8230; shit some gold!</p>
  
  <p>It was the doll that was speaking!  Quickly, they placed a white napkin beneath it, and out it shat some gold louis.  And every night it did the same thing.</p>
  
  <p>The three girls were soon very rich.  A neighbor heard about this and found out how they had gained their fortune.  One night, after supper, he went to pay a visit to his young neighbors, and, as the evening went on, he pretended to doze off by their hearth.</p>
  
  <p>Bedtime arrived, and the children went to their bedroom, suspecting nothing.  </p>
  
  <p>&#8212; He&#8217;ll leave when he wakes up, said one of the sisters.</p>
  
  <p>When he was satisfied that the girls had fallen asleep, the wily neighbor opened his eyes and pricked up his ears.  After some time he heard the voice of the doll:</p>
  
  <p>&#8212; Give me some white toilet paper, because I need to shit&#8230; shit some gold!</p>
  
  <p>He rose softly and, as the girls slept soundly, he snatched the little doll and crept away without a sound.</p>
  
  <p>Once at his house, he said to his wife:</p>
  
  <p>&#8212; Go find some white toilet paper and put it under this doll.  Soon enough, a fortune will tumble out of its ass!</p>
  
  <p>The wife spread their finest white toilet paper under the doll&#8230; who shat, not some gold louis, but the stinkiest filth, much to the great horror of the man and his wife.</p>
  
  <p>The next day, at the same hour, they placed another napkin of the finest toilet paper under the doll, and the little thing presented the same gift.  So the furious couple tossed the doll out onto their dunghill.</p>
  
  <p>The king happened to be passing through at this time and stopped right there to tend to an urgent need.  The doll chomped down on the king&#8217;s ass, refusing to let go.  Greatly displeased with his new hardship, the king appealed to all the world for relief.  He begged all who appeared at his court to extract the doll, adding that anyone who could deliver him of this monster would be given anything they desired.</p>
  
  <p>And so the youngest of the three sisters presented herself before the king.  The doll recognized her immediately, and soon the girl was cradling it in her arms.  The king gratefully acknowledged his debt to the lovely young girl and pledged before all the world to wed her.  Some months later he kept his word and made a wife of the mistress of the biting doll.</p>
  
  <p>The End</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is based on a Provençal version of the story.  Le Conte Populaire français also mentions a variant recounted by a French Canadian living in the U.S.  In this version, the doll does not speak but is set into motion by the incantation &#8220;Crap, crap, my little slut.&#8221;  There also is no king; rather, it is the neighbor who is bitten in the ass after forgetting where he threw the doll.</p>

A Gang of Four performance works like this:  The music is chopped up funk, and the lyrics a juxtaposition of the everyday and the dreadful, like death's heads pasted onto the Sunday newspaper advertisements.  Andy Gill is the Straight Man, his gaze fixed dead ahead, pointing the neck of his guitar into a roiling crowd he probably can't see.  Jon King is The Fool.  He scrambles and falls up and down the stage, but always finds the microphone on cue, like a silent comedy star, every pratfall and seeming misstep perfectly in accordance with the rhythm and logic of a constructed situation.  But King's no Buster Keaton, who  can hold an expression of deadpan seriousness while he, for example, obligingly runs up a spinning waterwheel like a gerbil, his only concern to keep his hat on straight -- King is a man backed into a corner, and his expression is one of terror.
</p>
<p>
Writing that gives me the uneasy feeling that I'm parroting something I've already read about the band somewhere else.  After seeing the Gang of Four live, it's hard not to suspect that they too might have read, say, the liner notes Greil Marcus had written for one of their anthologies and made sure to play their roles to the letter.  During "He'd Send in the Army," somebody wheeled out a battered microwave oven, which Jon King then whacked intently with a baseball bat for the duration of the song.  I spent the song anxiously eyeing the girl leaning on the stage directly in front of the microwave, worried that it would finally burst into a hundred glass and plastic fragments, but nothing happened.  King beats on the prop oven on every show of the tour; I had even already read that.  Later, or maybe earlier, I don't remember, they played "Anthrax," and Andy Gill tossed his shrieking guitar around the stage while a roadie scrambled around after it, the feedback meanwhile sounding exactly as it does on the record.  He looked the whole time as if he was going through the motions, playing the part of a rock guitarist, which is of course precisely what he was doing.  The entire show was near perfect; the performance was exactly as I had read in accounts from 1980 or 1984.  At the merchandise booth, a disc consisting of rerecordings of their old songs were being sold.
</p>
<p>
There's a certain kind of music fan that recoils at this kind of expertly executed professionalism.  They insist on spontaneity and "honesty," and this has the stink of a rock star.  I'm stupid and naive, think like this all the time, and thought it a few times during the show.  But if the Gang of Four seemed at times as if they had been reduced to common entertainers rather than teachers or agitators, it's partially a consequence of what they have set out to do and how they've set about doing it, and partially the fault of an audience that can't seem to tell the difference.  When the band played "Ether," the crowd heaved with zeal.  Andy Gill shouted out lyrics that should be chilling, the most specific and explicitly topical lines in the band's repertoire -- "LOCK DOWN LONG KESH," "H-BLOCK TORTURE," "WHITE NOISE IN A WHITE ROOM," "THERE MAY BE OIL UNDER ROCKALL" -- and the audience shouted them back, stripped bare of any meaning and intent, in a kind of rapture by rote.  This is what an audience does.  The crowd moved like a centipede on its back.
</p>
<p>
(Between every song a young man yelled out, loudly, persistently, "We Live As We Dream, Alone!"  Somebody finally snapped and said: "They'll play whatever they want to play!"  He looked at the floor abashedly but muttered, "It's a fucking punk rock show."  I have no idea how to judge that exchange.)

Sunday night I dreamed that I fished a buzzing, squirming hummingbird from my left ear.  "What are you doing in there?" I asked the hummingbird.  "Cleaning out the spiderwebs," it said.  I eased the hummingbird back into my head.

<p>
Monday night I dreamed that I was in a van with my friend Dean, delivering a hot chicken fried steak meal to a strange little man.  He was both a mafia tough and a diabolic Celtic fairy -- a pooka or a leprechaun, maybe.  I remember a feeling of mounting terror, as I had secretly eaten half of the food, and Dean was casually deflecting my attempts to abandon him.

Tuesday night I swallowed two antihistamines and drank a glass of water before sleeping and dreamed of nothing.

"Benedicite! What eyleth the man, so synfully to swere?" said Chaucer's Parson in <a href="http://www.hti.umich.edu/cgi/c/cme/cme-idx?type=HTML&amp;rgn=DIV1&amp;byte=15805298">The Canterbury Tales</a>, while <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/211/1613.html">Dan Michel</a>, in his 14th-century self-help manual <a href="http://www.hti.umich.edu/cgi/c/cme/cme-idx?type=HTML&amp;rgn=DIV0&amp;byte=26581765">Ayenbite of Inwyt</a>, warned: "Hi hise clepieþ ydele wordes ac hi ne byeþ. Ac hi byeþ of grat cost and harmuolle and perilous."  (I'm not certain that I follow, but regardless, imagine if your parents had chastised you in such a manner when you were a kid!  My response would have been:  "The value of your words is primarily philological, <em>Dad.</em>")
</p>
<p>
During the 1960 obscenity trial over Lady Chatterley's Lover, prosecutor Mervyn Griffiths-Jones reportedly said, "Would you want your wife or servants to read this book?"  Had I seen the chart he had presented to the court -- see below -- my answer would have been "Yes," giving away the fact that I cheated and read the final chapter of Ulysses without finishing the rest of the book, apparently missing "<a href="http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~rac101/concord/texts/ulysses/ulysses.cgi?word=cunty">cunty</a>" in the process.

A selective count of vulgar words in three literary works

    Lady Chatterley's Lover

    * Note that this count is constituted by exact words, and does not include variants (like Wakeisms) or cases where a given word occurs within a longer or compounded word (e.g., "shite," or the more unusual "cunty," both of which appear four times in Ulysses): thus, the two incidents of "fuck" in Ulysses do not account for the use of "fucking."

Have you ever heard Chris Bell's "<a href="http://www.chompy.net/blogs/jacob/music/Chris Bell - I Am the Cosmos.mp3">I Am the Cosmos</a>?"  It sounds as if it were sung by a damned, groaning spirit; it's one of the most miserable songs I've heard in my life.  Bell's just singing about talking on the phone or driving his girl home, but he produces a wretchedness that is deep and vast, an infinite sphere, of which the center is everywhere, and the circumference nowhere.  Like all good pop music, it makes me feel like a teenager, delirious and stupid and self-absorbed, but kind of grown-up, too.  I've been listening to the song obsessively today, yesterday, and last week, playing it over and over.  This makes no sense, because I've actually been feeling extraordinarily cheerful.  As soon as the song finishes I play it again, drawn to the majestic hurt and loathing of the music, allowing my brain to trickle forth a few delicious painful associations, but my good mood is unshakeable still.  The more I hear the song, the better I feel, actually.  Where does this come from, I wonder?  I feel like one of those idiot schoolchildren that made me want to die of old age at eight years, the ones that interrupted my earnest sketchings of minotaurs and archdevils, lifting up their shirts and daring me to punch them in the gut.  Feel my muscles!
</p>
<p>
So what draws me to this song, then?  There is something compellingly romantic, I suppose, about sad, sad music -- well, sadness in general.  In this time and place so well suited to smug comfort, a thousand bumper stickers attest daily to some need for vicarious tragedy, something awful and bigger than any one of us, though perhaps not entirely real.  You want to be made to feel that your unhappiness is but a single string of taut emotion on an aeolian harp of cosmic crumminess, over which the vast breeze of universal misery sweeps.   Listen -- have you read the story by Mishima, the one about the young man who must break off his romance with his girl?  He resolves to do it one night -- no, that's not right, he has been planning it all along, calculating and anticipating even as he was courting her, holding her hands, making love to her.  He breaks the news to her at a tea shop while outside a storm thunders.  She says nothing, but immediately begins to cry.  He leaves the shop, not as pleased as he would have liked, and she follows him into the rain, silent and weeping.  He resents this, he hopes to make her feel ridiculous, puny.  He leads her to the imperial palace, where three great fountains spew water against the rain.  The two walk and walk, and still the girl is crying, the boy's dismissals drowned out amidst the great fountains and the falling rain.  The girl slips in a puddle.  The boy walks into a doorway; a bucket of water falls on his head.  Bonk!  He ought to feel stupid, shouldn't he?  But:  The storm does not abate,  and the earth quakes, and the island is engulfed by a tsunami, and the entire country is swallowed by the sea.
</p>
<p>
I may have misrepresented the details or even the point of the story, but it doesn't matter, does it.

        <summary type="text">Competing for his third Olympic crown, Arrichion had found himself being choked in a stranglehold from behind. Unable to free himself from the ferocious grip, Arrichion managed to grip his opponent's ankle and twist it until it broke. In agony his opponent submitted, but by then the damage was done - Arrichion's throat had been crushed and even as he was proclaimed the winner, he breathed his last.</summary>

This is boring site news; more ass poetry to follow. I'm debating whether or not to stick with Movable Type. Yesterday, Six Apart announced a tiered pricing structure for MT, with pricing based on the number of users and weblogs per installation. This came as something of a surprise:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.movabletype.org/news/2003_02.shtml#000783">Movable Type Pro Announcement, February 2003</a>: "Movable Type Pro will be a for-pay version," and "a version with the features that power users require."</li>
<li><a href="http://www.movabletype.org/news/2003_12.shtml#000878">Movable Type 3.0 Announcement, December 2003</a>: "The next version of Movable Type will be version 3.0, a significant and free upgrade."</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sixapart.com/corner/archives/2004/04/wheres_the_beef.shtml">Movable Type 3.0 Update, April 2004</a>: "Movable Type 3.0 is not the fabled 'Pro' version as originally described," and "MT 3.0 benefits from ... a coherent and fair pricing plan that still lets us have a free version of Movable Type 3.0."  Without the benefit of hindsight, it was not yet possible to interpret the latter statement as "My family web site will now cost me <a href="http://uigui.com/log/2004/may/movable_license.uigui">$600</a>."</li>
<li><a href="http://secure.sixapart.com/">Movable Type 3.0 Pricing, May 2004</a>: "free" (with restrictions) to "$100,000,000,000"</li>
</ul>
<p>
The resulting debate is divided between the "what the fuck?" camp and the "pay for it, freeloader" camp.  The latter group is exemplified by a-list blogger Dave Winer, who <a href="http://archive.scripting.com/2004/05/14#playingRealGoodForFree">writes</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yesterday we saw people complain about spending $60 for a big useful piece of software like Movable Type. I paid $60 for a cab ride in Geneva. A good dinner is $100.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Bear this quote in mind the next time you catch yourself thinking that the rhetoric of class warfare is quaint.  Anyway, I fall into the "what the fuck?" group; I don't believe that moral authority derives from my pocketbook.  In a pinch, however, I can play that game; I've donated time, money, and effort to Six Apart in the past, and I will <em>probably</em> purchase an upgrade as a gesture of gratitude for two years of using Movable Type, not to mention, funnily enough, because I'm not the only user at this site.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, I'm looking at alternatives.  I can't afford this expense nor can I afford this hassle for every site that I run or plan to run.  With <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">free software</a> (examples: the <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">web server</a>, <a href="http://www.mysql.org/">database</a>, and <a href="http://www.perl.org/">programming language</a> needed to run Movable Type), this sort of thing <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2004/05/14/freedom-0">is not a problem</a>.  Not because it's <em>free</em>, but because it's <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html"><em>Free</em></a>.
</p>
<p>
Incidentally, have you tried <a href="http://www.gmail.com/">Gmail</a> yet?
</p>
<p>
In other news, I've been running a free <a href="http://palcontent.blogspot.com/">Blogger site</a> for use when testing chompy's Atom feed handling, and in response to a trivial technical complaint about banner ads, I received a complimentary upgrade to their ad-free service.  Swell.

Seems lovelier than before,<br />
But thus reveals his ass.

The intermittent huge puddle under the urinals at work concerns me. It comes and goes, lately with increasing frequency, like warm weather in the springtime. Today it was under the right urinal, yesterday it was under the left urinal. Of course I don't stand in the puddle -- who would? -- but I can't avoid those urinals entirely, either. While I assiduously leak into the opposite stall, that golden bloom is seeping into the tiles, a reeking marinade of hygienic failure, and I know I'll stand there eventually, the faded puddle forgotten.
</p>
<p>
And so I fear for my sneakers.  People say that your hair and your mouth, possibly your fingernails, too, are the filthiest parts of your bodies, teeming with microbial horrors. Filthiest parts of your body, yes, but it's my shoes that worry me. I don't mop my hair daily on that piss-darkened floor, I don't gnaw on the urined ground, I don't dig my nails into the peesoaked grout and tile, but I plant my shoes there several times a day, rocking foot to foot in my beautiful fraying black Chuck Taylors, maybe whistling, maybe staring blankly at some fixed point on the wall, effluvia wafting past unnoticed, completely clear of mind. I really should throw them in the wash.  Or maybe try the women's room.
