                <p>And that’s <em>all</em> I’m going to say about the subject under debate
until, well, somewhat later.</p>
                <h2 id="p-1">Travel</h2>
                <p>The trans-Atlantic slog from Vancouver is unpleasant, but then
the transfer gates at Frankfurt were like a hundred feet apart, and the hop to
Geneva is nothing.
At the airport there’s a machine that’ll print you a public-transit
ticket good for anywhere in the city.  I looked at the sun outside and thought
“screw taxis” and was downtown in minutes.  I thought the train station would
be pretty near the hotel, so I bought a map and sallied forth, was baffled in
half a block.</p>
                <p>I summoned up my courage, shook some rust off the internal French-language
gears, and approached a policeman.  He was friendly and helpful; even walked
me a couple of blocks in the right direction.  And the French worked
better than I’d hoped.
Over in the German-speaking part of Switzerland, the German sounds funny.  But
the French here sounds ordinary to me.</p>
                <h2 id="p-2">The Venue</h2>
                <p>I thought I’d do a trial walk from my hotel to the meeting location.
Are there ever a lot of glass-faced buildings around here.</p>
                <img src="R0010167.png" alt="Glass-faced building in Geneva"/>
                <p>Anyhow, when I got back to the hotel I realized I’d snapped the building on
the wrong side of the street from where the meeting is, but hey, it’s the
<a href="http://www.itu.int/">ITU</a> world headquarters.  In the
neighborhood, more ways than one.</p>
                <img src="R0010168.png" alt="The ITU headquarters in Geneva"/>
                <p>For my sanity’s sake I’ll try to find something else to write about this
week.</p>

                <p>I see they’ve dropped the price of the basic iPod Shuffle to $49.
That’s the only iPod I have.  It’s a remarkable device, with enough songs and
enough juice to get you over the Pacific and back.  You just have to remember
to auto-fill and recharge before you go.
The ergonomics are minimal
and kind of perfect.
Now, everybody knows that the best gift for anyone is one you make yourself.
It seems to me that a pre-loaded Shuffle qualifies, at a reasonable
price-point.</p>
                <p>A couple of years ago, I gave shuffles to a nephew and two nieces.  I
thought of pre-loading them, but they wouldn’t be able to refresh them from
their own computers without blanking the music, so what would be the point?</p>
                <p>At $49, it makes sense.  It presupposes you’ve got a computer with a few
dozen hours of music on it; many of us have.  You go and buy a handful of
shuffles for your friends and loved ones, and for each one, you pick out 16
hours of songs you think they might like, and let ’er rip.</p>
                <p>If they don’t like your taste in music, they’ve got a little iPod they can
put their own on.  If they do, that’s a very personal gift.</p>

till last year, when I started working on
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/misc/Software#p-5">mod-atom</a>.  He’s
one of the core
<a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">httpd</a> gurus, and
<a href="http://www.apachetutor.org/">wrote the book</a> on Apache Modules,
which is what mod-atom is.  So he politely tolerated a flurry of
clueless-newbie questions from me, and I feel guilty that I didn’t buy the
book.
Anyhow, he’s just
<a href="http://bahumbug.wordpress.com/2008/02/21/servant-to-a-new-master/">come
to work for Sun</a>.  I’ve already told him gleefully that I shall now feel
guilt-free about the questions.  But seriously, it makes me happy to be
bringing some more httpd expertise on board, given that it’s perhaps the
single most important software component of the whole World Wide Web.
Welcome aboard, Nick!</p>

Google's Ass...</a>.  Spot a pattern?</p>
                <p>The first is easy to understand, because we’ve seen it so many times
before.  I remember the relentless campaigns over the last decade, first
to turn the Internet from a Navigator app into an Explorer app, and second to
beat back the demons of Open Source.
There were all sorts of incentives to adopt cool Web-site features that were
IE-only, and the nicest imaginable Microsoft evangelists to explain the
advantages, and fatherly business types to pooh-pooh objections from any of
those scuzzy Open-Source commie hippies.</p>
                <p>The formula goes: you find some organization,
not all that clueful about technology, you dazzle ’em with shiny
goodies, and you lock in another little piece of the Internet.
Well, it’s sad that the Library of Congress doesn’t want any visitors who run
Linux, or aren’t affluent enough to have upgraded to an Intel Mac.
Sad, sad, sad.</p>
                <p>Now, Google and the Republicans.  That’s too complicated for me to figure
out, but it smells rotten (granted that in 2008, everything in
the neighborhood of the Republican party smells rotten).
Anyhow, read Jeremy Zawodny’s take, linked above.
I’d forgotten that when the time is right,
he can be one of your really superior flamers.  And the time does seem
right.</p>

                <p>Brian McCallister, in
<a href="http://kasparov.skife.org/blog/src/atomsub.html">AtomSub</a>, raised
a fascinating idea: “Would be nice to push an AtomPub endpoint to a service as
a callback for events... Instead of polling a site for updates, post a
subscription with an AtomPub endpoint as the entry and let the service push to
you.”  I would never have thought of such a thing; hmmmm.</p>

which says some smart things.  Mind you, he then follows some complaints about
the 
“frustration” of searching for Atompub server-side implementations with a list of
five, all in different languages.</p>
                <p>Including
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/misc/Software#p-5">mod-atom</a>.
One reason I’ve been blogging less is actually because I’ve been working on
mod-atom, and frankly, it’s of no general interest whatsoever.  Yeah, I think
mod-atom or something like it is potentially an important piece of the
infrastructure, but its actual engineering, inside, is pretty boring.
I’ve figured out a trick for creating and destroying publications without
hacking the Apache config file.
Since then I’ve spent a few days, actually, thinking about how, in the
maybe-processes-but-maybe-threads httpd environment, best to keep track of all
the active publications when you’re adding and deleting them.  Which is pretty
hard to do efficiently.  But nobody would call it <em>interesting</em>.</p>

been

                <p>This is getting a little weird.  Twice in the last couple of years, Linus
Torvalds has gone out of his way to diss Solaris, the OS technology and Sun
corporately.
Now, anyone who’s spent time on a mailing list with Linus knows that
his opinions are sharp-edged and rarely withheld.  But now we have a
pure 
<a href="http://www.linux-foundation.org/weblogs/amanda/2008/02/17/hey-jonathan-the-l-in-lamp-is-literal/">attack piece</a>
from Amanda McPherson, identified as “the marketing director of the Linux
Foundation”.</p>
                <p>She goes on about how the L in LAMP is Linux and Literal; and how Sun in
general and Jonathan in particular are hopeless losers because there are more
of them than of us.  Oh, and because there’s a nasty little dispute in the
OpenSolaris community.</p>
                <p>Well, let me be clear: I like GNU/Linux, in particular the GNU userland
part which I’m delighted to see the Solaris guys finally warming up to.  The
blog you’re reading runs on a Debian box and I use Ubuntu in my living room.
And I run Solaris for concurrency work and when I need NetBeans to go really
fast.  And it’s all just fine.</p>
                <p>And yeah, the OpenSolaris community has had some foot-stomping of
late, and IMHO the Governing Board needs to do some Governing PDQ.
But, uh, flare-ups around personalities and naming and
so on are not exactly earth-shaking news in any of the OSS communities that
I’ve lived in. (Well, except for Ruby.  But I digress).  Perhaps GNU/Linux has
been blessedly free of such things?</p>
                <p>But whatever.  Yes, there are more Linuxians at the moment.  I’m one myself
from time to time.  The software is good.  There is competition now.  This is
also good.  The childish sneering?  Not good.</p>

                <p>It was late, everyone else long asleep.  I was walking between the dining
table and the kitchen counter (not a very wide space) when, from the
counter-top, I heard a soft little discrete clinking sound, some electronic
device wanting attention.  It would not be surprising for such a thing to be
found on our kitchen counter, but I didn’t recognize the sound.  It would be a
little more surprising, but not very, if the device on the counter
were unknown to me.  So I turned back and around where I could see the
counter, which was only moderately cluttered, and spotted no electronics at
all aside from a couple of battery chargers.  They multiply like bunny
rabbits
when you’re not looking, producing slightly variant hybrids that don’t work
with whatever needs charging next; then the original wanders away.  But I
digress.  I was puzzled but decided to let it pass, and returned to my
original errand.  <i>Soft discrete clink.</i>  I looked again: cookie jar,
bottle of wine, butter, chargers, extension cord draped over the back of
the counter, toaster.  Well, whatever.  Turn around, step, <i>clink</i>.  Wait
a second, there’s a pattern.  I was brushing the cord and its end was
swinging against the wine bottle.  It sounded amazingly like a friendly alert
envisioned and sculptured by a spiky-haired User Experience engineer in
Shibuya.  Real imitating fake, there you go.</p>

                <p>We seem to have pretty widespread consensus, these days, that HTTP, or
perhaps the 
RESTful approach it exemplifies, offers a pretty sweet substrate for pushing
and pulling data around at Web scale.  We got further evidence this week when
a bunch of smart people stepped slightly outside its sweet spot, into deep
tangly weeds.</p>
                <p>First, Joe Gregorio of Google, in
<a href="http://bitworking.org/news/296/How-To-Do-RESTful-Partial-Updates">How
to do RESTful Partial Updates</a>, proposed overloading PUT to
update resources in a way that’s constrained using
<a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/URI-Templates/">URI
templates</a>.</p>
                <p>He got push-back from
<a href="http://intertwingly.net/blog/2008/02/15/Embrace-Extend-then-Innovate">Sam
Ruby</a> and (more severely)
<a href="http://www.snellspace.com/wp/?p=889">James Snell</a>.  There is
thoughtful commentary from
<a href="http://www.mnot.net/blog/2008/02/17/post_patch">Mark Nottingham</a>,
<a href="http://blog.mozilla.com/rob-sayre/2008/02/15/restful-partial-updates/">Rob
Sayre</a>, and
<a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/2008/02/16/ThoughtsOnGooglesProposalForGranularUpdatesInAtomPub.aspx">Dare
Obasanjo</a>.
I have three observations.</p>
                <h2 id="p-1">Wikipedia No</h2>
                <p>I think Joe’s analogy with Wikipedia is bogus.  At Wikipedia, each entry is a
resource.  So is each section and sub-section and sub-sub-section and so on.
There’s nothing at all in REST to say that resources can’t be part of other
resources, and there’s no ambiguity at all what’s going on at Wikipedia.
Unfortunately, at Wikipedia there’s no way to do what Joe’s trying to: update
more than one disjoint section at a time.</p>
                <h2 id="p-2">It’s Important</h2>
                <p>The problem Joe’s trying to solve keeps coming up.  Despite my skepticism
about the analogy, I think his URI-templates approach is potentially
a winner.  Like Sam, I’m not crazy about verbs in URIs, but maybe, seen
correctly, these are adverbs.</p>
                <p>There’s some history here, private and public.  Way back in 2004 I was
trying to get Google to buy into the APP idea, and had a meeting with Adam
Bosworth and Mark Lucovsky, who are obviously both heavyweights.
They both were friendly to the idea, but had an immediate question: You’ve got
a decent way to create or update a Web resource, but what if you want to
update ten thousand, can you avoid doing an HTTP exchange for each?
What about the idea of POSTing an Atom feed rather than an Atom entry?</p>
                <p>I thought that sounded plausible; Google joined the Atompub WG and in
fairly short order the POST-a-feed idea came up.  And in fairly short order
after that, it got shot down.  People thought up all sorts of corner cases and
problems.  The two that stick to my mind were authorization and error
handling. Can you specify different auth data for each of the ten thousand
entries in the feed, and how do you react when twenty-seven of the ten
thousand fail to update for some reason or another?</p>
                <p>I was disappointed, but thought “Well, YAGNI, maybe.”
Since then, there’s been Yaron Goland’s
<a href="http://dev.live.com/livedata/web3s.htm">Web3S</a> proposal, whose
<i>raison d’etre</i> was update at other than the singular-resource level.
(Hmm, wondering what happened to Web3S?)</p>
                <p>So this is something that obviously keeps coming up.</p>
                <h2 id="p-3">It’s Hard</h2>
                <p>I have the advantage here of having spent three years
co-chairing an IETF Working Group, a role whose chief function is to discern
or decree the existence of consensus.  Speaking on the basis of that
experience, I can tell you authoritatively that we do <em>not</em> have
consensus here; rough, smooth, or any other kind.</p>
                <p>But it’s <em>totally</em> worth arguing about.</p>

                <p>Clearly, 
<a href="http://www.roughtype.com/">Nicholas Carr</a> disapproves of much of the culture in which
I’ve immersed myself and which I nearly-wholly embrace, to which I would apply
labels such as “online” or “Web” or “Internet” or “Twenty-first century”.
(Carr and I have written
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/08/09/Carr">back</a> and 
<a href="http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2006/08/ongoing.php">forth</a>
already on the generalities.)
So it would be reasonable to suspect me of bias in writing about his 
recent <a href="http://www.nicholasgcarr.com/bigswitch/">The Big
Switch—Rewiring the world, from Edison to Google</a>.
And indeed, I do think that several of its key arguments are, well,
<em>wrong</em>.  But it’s a good book anyhow; 
well written and extremely apposite.</p>
                <h2 id="p-1">Outline</h2>
                <p>The book embeds three themes, quite loosely
intertwined.
<i>First</i>, on the Really Big Analogy between Electricity and Information
Technology.  <i>Second</i>, on whether this Internet thingie is a Really Good
Idea or a Really Bad Idea.  <i>Third</i>, on whether the Net is an
Emergent Artificial Intelligence, and if so whether We Ought To Be Scared.</p>
                <p>The first is the most interesting.  Jonathan Schwartz has riffed at length
on this theme as well, and the analogies between the electrical industry back
then and IT today are pretty compelling.  My disappointment here is that Carr
seems to have stopped before getting to the end of the argument.  Nobody in,
say, a small manufacturing business is going to write their own payroll
system.  On the other hand, nobody in the financial industry is going to
outsource all their modeling and risk work to someone else’s software and
infrastructure.  The interesting question is, where’s the dividing line, what
is the underlying pattern?  What decision procedure should a manager follow
to address the own-or-outsource question?
Planning a sequel, Prof. Carr?</p>
                <h2 id="p-2">Emancipation or Control?</h2>
                <p>The book has two halves: the second, <cite>Living in the Cloud</cite>,
opens with several chapters outlining the surprising reach of the Net and Web
in 2008.  This would contain no surprises for <span class="o">ongoing</span>
readers, but is well-presented and likely useful for a general audience.</p>
                <p>Then the fun starts, as Carr considers whether the Net embodies
“technologies of emancipation” or “technologies of control”.  His conclusion,
unsurprisingly, is that it’s about control.  The argument is worth reading
but I found it entirely unconvincing.  The Internet is about <em>people</em>
and that’s all it’s about.  People’s behavior is sometimes noble and sometimes
shitty, and the Internet doesn’t change that.  Given the chance to accrue
power, individuals and groups will usually take it.  When they misuse it,
other individuals and groups will try to break that power.  Sometimes they’ll
succeed and sometimes they won’t. There’ll be tyrannies and collectives and
complacency and insurgencies and wealth and poverty wherever there are people,
and I just don’t see how the Net makes any qualitative difference.</p>
                <p>Hold on... I think what we have here is Prof. Carr predicting a sea-change
and me saying “Nah, nothing really new.”  Good.</p>
                <h2 id="p-3">Intelligence?</h2>
                <p>The closing section considers whether the Net constitutes an emergent
intelligence.  It’s pretty disappointing; Carr obviously hasn’t researched the
miserable decades-long failure of the Artificial Intelligence project. He even
uncritically relays the exciting news from some AI lab: the researchers have
“already succeeded in creating a software program that can, at a very basic
level, ‘read’ sentences on Web pages and extract meaning from them—without
requiring any tags from programmers.”  Wow!  Stop the presses!  Someone call
Doug Lenat!</p>
                <p>I’ve
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/06/24/IntelligentSearch">written about this
before</a>, but the core point is worth re-emphasizing: If we actually
understood what intelligence was and how it worked, we could maybe replicate
it.  We don’t, so we can’t.  (I suspect that someday we will; I’m not a victim
of the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_room">Chinese-Room</a>
illusion).</p>
                <p>Anyhow, it seems that I’ve been grumbling and grouching here, mostly.  But
to some degree that’s a compliment: if I weren’t engaged by the narrative I
wouldn’t have taken the time to go through it, take notes, and write this. I
think that most people who enjoy <span class="o">ongoing</span> would enjoy
reading <cite>The Big Switch</cite>.</p>
                <p>And the epilogue, <cite>Flame and Filament</cite>, is a perfect little
two-page jewel: startling, clear-eyed, and beautifully written; perhaps
itself worth the price of the whole book.  I’m going to quote the last
sentence: “It’s in this way that progress covers its tracks, perpetually
refreshing the illusion that where we are is where we were meant to be.”
Which is true even if you lose the “were”.</p>

GX100</a>, but a camera shouldn’t need a middle name.  Mine arrived
yesterday.</p>
                <img src="IMG_0012.png" alt="Ricoh Caplio GX100"/>
                <h2 id="p-1">Why?</h2>
                <p>You just gotta have a pocket camera, because the single greatest factor in
taking good photos is being ready to shoot when opportunity knocks.  I still
regret my deceased Canon S70, and while I got some OK shots with the
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/04/27/Canon-A710-IS">Canon A710</a>, I never
actually <em>liked</em> it that much; the ergonomics were so-so and it
wouldn’t shoot RAW and the shutter lag was irritating.</p>
                <p>On paper, the Ricohs scratch a few of those itches, then when I was
in Tokyo last year, it 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/06/15/Cameras">became obvious</a> that the
Ricohs are the preferred camera flavor among the Japanese geek contingent; I got
to fool with a couple of them and liked the feel.</p>
                <p>If you look at
<a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/ricohgx100/">DPReview’s take</a>,
it’s pretty negative, but the lines aren’t hard to read between: on the
upside, the
ergonomics are great, the wide-angle is huge, the thing reacts fast, and the
lens is good.  On the downside, the JPEG conversion is second-rate in anything
but really excellent light; and the dynamic range is not that great, it’s easy
to blow out the highlights.</p>
                <p>Well, I’d normally shoot RAW rather than JPEG anyhow, so the really big
downside isn’t that big an issue.  There is another issue in that the RAW
write speed is sluggish, so you can’t shoot a whole bunch in a row.</p>
                <p>Another alternative would be the much-ballyhooed
<a href="http://www.ricoh.com/r_dc/gr/gr_digital2/index.html">Ricoh GR Digital
II</a>,
with all the same ergonomic goodness and a neato prime lens too;
lately I’ve become a bit of a prime-lens junkie.</p>
                <p>I spent some time poking around the
<a href="http://ricohforum.com/">Ricoh Forum</a>, and it seems that the GX100
lens is not significantly behind the D2 where it matters, plus it’s a little
more resistant to highlight burnout.  And damn it, a pocket camera’s about
convenience, so why not a zoom?</p>
                <h2 id="p-2">Impressions</h2>
                <p>I unpacked it, I charged it up, I turned it on... nothing.  Talk about a
mood-destroyer.  Had to go out, when I came back an hour later it was fine.
Go figure.  So, late at night, the lights low, I jammed the ISO over to 800
and took the first shot at what I could see from where I was sitting.</p>
                <img src="R0010001.png" alt="Interior low-light test shot with Ricoh GX100"/>
                <p>Hey, the image stabilization is pretty good, that’s at 1/13 of a second.</p>
                <p>So I snuck up on the cat and balanced the camera on a stool: ¼-second
shutter.  Fortunately, the cat held still.</p>
                <img src="R0010004.png" alt="Cat in low light by Ricoh GX100"/>
                <p>Yeah, there’s a lot of luminance noise in those, but... usable, I’d
say.</p>
                <p>Today I was pinned by the phone/chat/email torrent from the moment I got
breakfast stuffed into the 
kids until like three PM, so after I got my shower I grabbed the Ricoh and
went around the block.</p>
                <p>The first crocuses are starting to think about showing their faces.</p>
                <img src="R0010014.png" alt="Young crocuses in dim light with Ricoh GX100"/>
                <p>I shot that one with both RAW and JPEG, and there’s no doubt that Lightroom
does a better job than the idiot software in the camera.  Don’t know how
visible it would be at screen resolutions.  Also, they’re right about the
sensitivity, I managed to blow out highlights even under the cloudy sky.
There are EV compensation tricks that the Ricoh Forum experts recommend, have
to learn them.</p>
                <p>The ergonomics, even in the first 24 hours, are wonderful!  It’s easier to
switch ISO and resolution and so on than with my Pentax.  And in decent light,
the shutter lag is amazing, up there in SLR territory.</p>
                <p>Hey, it even does <i>bokeh</i>!  The macro setting is <em>slow</em> but slick.</p>
                <img src="R0010024.png" alt="Yellow early-spring flower with the Ricoh GX100"/>
                <p>Obviously there’s quite a bit of learning that’ll need to happen.  I’m in
California and Geneva over the next two weeks, and I’ll leave the SLR at home;
forced education.</p>

                <p>First, there’s an OS X version which has a “Beta” label, but it downloads
fast (only 21M!), installs easy, and is 100% Mac-flavored, seems to more or
less Just Work.</p>
                <p>The defaults are silly though; 128M of memory and 8G of disk.  Neither 
<a href="http://www.nexenta.org/os/Download">Nexenta 1.0</a>
nor the 
<a href="http://opensolaris.org/os/project/indiana/resources/getit/">Indiana
Developer Preview</a> worked, nor did either provide useful error messages.
Cranking the memory to 1024M and the disk to 20G got them both to install.</p>
                <p>Nexenta couldn’t get out of console mode into X, but it seemed like a
perfectly functional Unix system.  Bug filed.</p>
                <p>Indiana had Gnome running, felt perfectly snappy, but couldn’t see my
Airport network.  I filed the bug and there was a workaround posted this
morning.</p>
                <p>VirtualBox tickles my fancy: small, lightweight, works.  Hmm... I wonder
how the Orange Box games will run on my Mac?</p>

Coincidentally, Lauren and I had to go into a Wal-Mart the other day, the
first time in years, and my whole nervous system just about imploded.  The
amount of stuff in those places, who could possibly need it all?  Anyhow I
figured they’d have to have DVD blanks, and they did, except for the price for
50 was only a buck more than the price for 20 so that’s what I had to buy.</p>
                <p>And I’m thinking, maybe this is the last writeable optical media I’ll ever
buy.  USB keys are getting close in size and you can write ’em a whole lot
faster, and they don’t occupy any more space, really.  The notion of using
them for long-term storage hasn’t caught on, but it’s only a matter of time.</p>
